if you can imagine a killing and super impressive personal protfolio for me that show my profile as a leading and high potential candidate for tech and AI. how do you imagine my protfolio should have and talk about. 


I have my linkedin, twitter and github (but did not do much on github publicly).

I have a lot of events where I was a speaker and a podcast. 

Imagine sending the vibes of like someone from stanford or harvard in tech. 


Let's highly what I did for bain - so I am a great contsiltant in stregegy and AI 

Also I am a great coder that a lot of AI. and I did a lot of training for executies and mangers. 

At sambanova, I am now on a another level, I am building large scale data scent er and AI infra for csovreugh Ai and compaoies , working directly with CEos and CTO , building new era of AI infrencing forfast LLM infernce wand low latency. 

I can highligh some of my customers that I worked with ....etc 


Also let;s do fulbrihht exoericence and that I am a fulbright scholar but not too much 


Again with all these details and what you know about me, let's make a proper protoflio and with a cool design that screen techn fuyure and sytrategiy and consulging na dexecityive leadershp.
