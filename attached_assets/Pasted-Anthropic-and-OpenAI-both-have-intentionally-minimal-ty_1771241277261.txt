Anthropic and OpenAI both have intentionally minimal, type‑driven visual identities, but Anthropic leans warm/ editorial while OpenAI is stark, geometric, and mostly monochrome. Below is a pragmatic breakdown you can reuse in decks, sites, or UI. [designyourway](https://www.designyourway.net/blog/openai-logo/)

***

## Anthropic visual identity

### Core color palette

Anthropic uses a muted off‑white + charcoal base with three earthy accents. [skills](https://skills.sh/anthropics/skills/brand-guidelines)

- Dark (primary text / dark UI background): `#141413`. [agent-skills](https://agent-skills.md/skills/anthropics/skills/brand-guidelines)
- Light (page background / dark‑mode text): `#FAF9F5`. [uicolours](https://uicolours.com/brands/anthropic)
- Mid gray (secondary text, borders): `#B0AEA5`. [skills](https://skills.sh/anthropics/skills/brand-guidelines)
- Light gray (subtle panels, dividers): `#E8E6DC`. [agent-skills](https://agent-skills.md/skills/anthropics/skills/brand-guidelines)

Accent colors (buttons, links, highlights): [uicolours](https://uicolours.com/brands/anthropic)

- Burnt orange (primary accent): `#D97757`.  
- Blue (secondary accent): `#6A9BCC`.  
- Green (tertiary accent): `#788C5D`.  

Some analyses also note a warm tan/brown in the logo lockup around `#D4A574`, but this appears more in editorial treatments than the core UI palette. [designyourway](https://www.designyourway.net/blog/anthropic-logo/)

### Typography

Anthropic’s documented styling uses a clean geometric **sans** for headings and a serif for body, giving it a humanist, editorial feel. [agent-skills](https://agent-skills.md/skills/zircote/.claude/brand-guidelines)

- Headings (H1–H3):  
  - Font: Poppins (sans‑serif).  
  - Weight: 500–600 for main headings, 400–500 for subheads (typical implementation; only “Poppins for headings” is specified). [agent-skills](https://agent-skills.md/skills/zircote/.claude/brand-guidelines)
  - Size guidelines (from brand skill docs): apply Poppins on headings *24pt and larger*. [agent-skills](https://agent-skills.md/skills/zircote/.claude/brand-guidelines)
  - Case: Sentence‑case or Title‑case; avoid ALL CAPS for long headings (Anthropic’s public site reflects this editorial tone).

- Body text:  
  - Font: Lora (serif).  
  - Weight: 400 (regular) for paragraphs, 500 for emphasis. [skills](https://skills.sh/anthropics/skills/brand-guidelines)
  - Suggested sizes in product/web contexts (not officially specified but consistent with usage):  
    - Desktop body: 16–18 px.  
    - Small UI labels: 12–14 px.  

- Fallbacks when brand fonts are unavailable:  
  - Headings: Arial.  
  - Body: Georgia. [agent-skills](https://agent-skills.md/skills/anthropics/skills/brand-guidelines)

### Layout and UI styling

From the internal “brand‑guidelines” skill and public UI: [agent-skills](https://agent-skills.md/skills/zircote/.claude/brand-guidelines)

- Backgrounds:  
  - Default page: solid **light** `#FAF9F5`.  
  - Cards / sections: either white on light background or very subtle tints of `#E8E6DC`.  
- Text color:  
  - Primary: `#141413`.  
  - Secondary/metadata: `#B0AEA5`.  
- Buttons:  
  - Primary: filled `#D97757` on light background, text `#FAF9F5`.  
  - Secondary: outlined with `#141413`, text `#141413`, transparent or very light background.  
- Shape styling:  
  - Non‑text shapes and icons rotate through orange, blue, and green accents to maintain visual interest while staying on‑brand. [skills](https://skills.sh/anthropics/skills/brand-guidelines)
- General feel: low‑contrast, warm, lots of negative space; minimal borders, preference for flat fills and understated shadows.

## OpenAI visual identity

### Core color palette

OpenAI’s official primary color is pure black; the logo and brand system are primarily monochrome. [brandpalettes](https://brandpalettes.com/openai-color-codes/)

- Primary brand color:  
  - Black: `#000000` (RGB 0,0,0; Pantone Black 6 C; CMYK often given as approx 60,40,40,100 in brand palettes). [brandpalettes](https://brandpalettes.com/openai-color-codes/)
- Neutral background:  
  - White: `#FFFFFF` for backgrounds, logo reversal, and high‑contrast layouts. [archive.area17](https://archive.area17.com/directory/2023_openai/36_brand-guidelines.pdf)

OpenAI has introduced extended grays and subtle blues in recent redesigns to soften the pure black/white contrast (e.g., site UI), but the formal logo palette is still black and white. [archive.area17](https://archive.area17.com/directory/2023_openai/36_brand-guidelines-OLD-2022.pdf)

### Logo usage basics

From the brand guidelines PDFs and secondary analyses: [designyourway](https://www.designyourway.net/blog/openai-logo/)

- Logo mark: the “Blossom” symbol (interlocking hexagonal knot) plus the wordmark “OpenAI”.  
- Approved color applications:  
  - Black logo on white background.  
  - White logo on black background.  
  - Avoid arbitrary colors; use official assets.  
- Clear space: maintain a minimum exclusion zone around the logo; exact measurements are defined in the internal PDF, typically tied to the “O” height (e.g., 0.5× or 1× logo height), but the public summaries only state “maintain prescribed clear space.” [archive.area17](https://archive.area17.com/directory/2023_openai/36_brand-guidelines-OLD-2022.pdf)
- Minimum size: PDFs note minimum pixel/print sizes to preserve legibility, but those numeric values are not exposed in public summaries; treat the Blossom mark cautiously below ~24 px height.

### Typography

The current wordmark uses a custom geometric sans called **OpenAI Sans**, drawn by ABC Dinamo. [designyourway](https://www.designyourway.net/blog/openai-logo/)

- Brand typeface:  
  - Font: OpenAI Sans (custom).  
  - Styles: 5 weights with italics; geometric sans with a perfectly circular “O”, balanced to avoid a cold, overly mechanistic look. [designyourway](https://www.designyourway.net/blog/openai-logo/)
  - Usage: logo wordmark, headings, and brand communications where allowed by license.  

- When OpenAI Sans is not available (e.g., when you are doing a “similar but not official” layout), common practice is to approximate with:  
  - Primary: a geometric/humanist sans like Inter, Söhne, or GT America (not official, but used in independent brand breakdowns).  
  - Sizes for typical web UI:  
    - H1: 32–40 px.  
    - H2: 24–32 px.  
    - Body: 16–18 px.  

OpenAI’s official guidelines do not publish a detailed typography spec publicly beyond naming OpenAI Sans and requiring the supplied assets for logo usage. [designyourway](https://www.designyourway.net/blog/openai-logo/)

### Layout and UI styling

From the older public guidelines and brand analyses: [archive.area17](https://archive.area17.com/directory/2023_openai/36_brand-guidelines.pdf)

- Backgrounds:  
  - Prefer pure **black** or **white** for logo placement.  
  - Web experiences often use dark themes with black or near‑black backgrounds, large white text, and generous padding.  
- Text color:  
  - Primary: white on dark backgrounds, black on light backgrounds. [archive.area17](https://archive.area17.com/directory/2023_openai/36_brand-guidelines.pdf)
- Buttons and accents:  
  - Historically: black/white fills with thin borders, minimal chromatic color.  
  - Newer UIs add subtle colored gradients and blues for call‑to‑action, but these are not formal logo colors and can evolve across product lines. [openai](https://openai.com)
- Overall style: high contrast, minimal ornamentation, strong grid alignment, large typography to give the Blossom and wordmark visual dominance. [archive.area17](https://archive.area17.com/directory/2023_openai/36_brand-guidelines-OLD-2022.pdf)

If you want, I can translate this into a ready‑to‑copy Figma or Tailwind token set for each brand so you can prototype “Anthropic‑style” and “OpenAI‑style” layouts for Sambanova demos.
