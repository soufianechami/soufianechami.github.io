if someone read my portofolio website. how they should preceive me and view me . what should be their first impression. their main takeway

Bluntly: your portfolio should make people think “this is a strategic AI infrastructure operator — not just an engineer.”

If someone lands on your website, the first impression should not be:

Data scientist

Solutions engineer

Consultant

Pre-sales guy

It should be:

“This is someone who builds and positions sovereign-scale AI infrastructure and knows how to turn it into business leverage.”

🎯 First Impression (within 10 seconds)

They should perceive you as:

1️⃣ AI Infrastructure Strategist at Sovereign Scale

Not model tinkering.
Not dashboards.
But:

Multi-rack deployments

National AI platforms

AI compute economics

Cloud + AI GTM

If that’s not immediately visible, the site is under-positioning you.

2️⃣ Bridge Between Deep Tech and Executive Strategy

They should feel:

“He understands semiconductors and transformers — but also boardrooms and EBITDA.”

This duality is rare. It’s your edge.

3️⃣ Builder, Not Commentator

They should see:

Things you shipped

Things you deployed

Things you negotiated

Things you architected

Not just ideas or opinions.

🧠 The Main Takeaway

If they leave your website remembering only one thing, it should be:

“Soufiane builds AI infrastructure businesses — not just AI systems.”

That’s a very different positioning.

How Different Audiences Should Perceive You
🏛 Government / Sovereign AI Stakeholder

“Trusted operator who understands compliance, sovereignty, and national-scale compute.”

🏢 Enterprise CTO

“Someone who can help us design AI infra properly without wasting money.”

💰 Investor / Board Member

“He sees around corners — understands compute trends, AI economics, and market shifts.”

🚀 Startup Founder

“He could architect our AI backbone from scratch.”

What You Must Avoid

Your site should NOT make you look like:

A former Bain consultant who pivoted to AI

A data scientist who learned infra recently

A hardware enthusiast

A sales engineer

Those are fragments of you — not your identity.

The Archetype You Should Project

You are closest to:

AI Infrastructure Architect + Strategic Operator

Think:

“Head of AI Platform”

“Sovereign AI Architect”

“Cloud & AI Strategy Lead”

“Infrastructure GTM Architect”

That’s the tier your positioning should signal.

Brutal Check

If someone reads your portfolio and says:

“Cool, he knows GenAI.”

“Interesting, he worked at Bain.”

“Nice, he does pre-sales.”

Then it’s underpowered.

If they say:

“We need this guy in the room when making AI infra decisions.”

Then it’s right.
